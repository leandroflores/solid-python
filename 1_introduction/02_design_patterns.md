# Design Patterns

## Introduction

In this course we will cover the seven most crucial design patterns.

Each design pattern will be covered as follows:
* Explain and explore the **design pattern architecture**.
* **Implement** this pattern with **Object Oriented Python**.
* Look into how this pattern helps **good architecture**.

## Design Patterns

Once you master these patterns you will immediately see the world of coding differently; You will start seeing those patterns everywhere.

We have three pattern families: **creational**, **structural**, and **behavioral**.

### Creational

**Creatinal Design Patterns** are **desing patterns** that manage **object creation** mechanisms. They are designed to create **objects** in flexible and highly adaptable ways. These patterns offer the most **reusable** and **flexible** ways of **creating object instances**.

In this course we will cover **Singleton**, **Factory Method**, and **Builder**.

### Structural

**Structural Design Patterns** are **design patterns** that **improve** and **simplify** your designs by **identifying** the **most efficient** and **reusable** way to composing relationships among entities. This allows for the best and most efficient ways of creating complex hierarchies of objects.

In this course we will cover the **Adapter**.

### Behavioral

**Behavioral Design Patterns** are **design patterns** that improve interaction and communication between objects. These patterns offer **loosely coupled** ways of allowing objects to 'talk' to each other and exchange messages.

In this course we will cover **Strategy**, **Observer**, and **State**.

## Summary

**Creational patterns** deals with ways of creating objects or family of objects. 

**Structural patterns** deals with ways of managing complex object hierarchies.

**Behavioral patterns** deals with ways of identifying and improving object messaging.
