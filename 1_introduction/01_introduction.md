# Design Patterns

## Introduction

- **Design patterns** are well-tested and resulable solutions.
- They are like a **solution template** for how to solve common Software Engineering problems.
- They are **flexible** and **adaptable**.
- They save time because they are optimal.

## Motivation

- You know that you are using something that has been utilized successfully in projects before.
- They are like a common meta-language for developers.
- You can think of a pattern as a common vocubulary for architects.
- We are on the same pages, and this is powerful.
- Design patterns in general, carry over to different programming languages.
- If you understand a pattern in a general manner, then you know that regardless of the language implementation, it will effectively offer the same **useful solution**.

## Summary

- Design Patterns are associated with good, well organized Software Design.
- As developers, we are prone to mistakes and sometimes inexperienced decisions.
- Think of design patterns as a bag of **reusable experience** from many generations of coders and Software Engineers, that we got to learn from.
