# SOLID Principles with Python

**Objective:** presents the concepts and applications of **SOLID** principles with the Python Programming Language.

SOLID is an acronym for a group of five principles in computer programming.

SOLID stands for:
- **S**ingle-Responsability Principle: "there should never bem more than a reason for a class to change."
- **O**pen-Close Principle: "Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle: "functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle: "clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
- **D**epedency Inversion Principle: "depend upon abstractions, (not) concretes."
